A long-defunct empire which once held territories the world over, largely responsible for the proliferation of written language throughout the world. It is said that The Empire was founded in the days long before [[Ymir]] fell, in the age of the [[Fourth Emanation]], by a man who was as one with the will of [[Ishad]]. In the days before the [[Triumvirate]], the [[Isztani]] established a foothold in Northern [[Shaal’Rond]] by conquering the [[Gamari Caliphate]] and annexing the [[Goldmoors]]. [[Isztani]] rulership of the [[Goldmoors]], and subsequently their influence in [[Shaal’Rond]] dissolved almost immediately after The Fall. Their legacy remains in the form of the [[Ijeetas]] and the remaining [[Iszadar]]. (The [[Ik’Torö]] names for a series of spiritual texts on the nature of [[Ishad]] and the [[Isztani]] priestly class, respectively.)
