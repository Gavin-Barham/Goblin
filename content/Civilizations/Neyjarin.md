The [[Neyjarin]] were a population of Elves who left the Wellspring in the age of the [[Second Emanation]]. They were not possessed with the same innate powers of inner-knowing as the [[Yrilari]], but had an insatiable hunger for exploration and knowledge through direct experience.. They exhibited a deep kinship and harmony with all of nature, being adepts of Kirukâ€™s terrain, and friends of all the Wildplaces. They were the only culture to regularly cohabitate with the native beastfolk, faeries, spirits, and gnomes of them.
