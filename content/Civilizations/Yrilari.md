The Yrilari were a culture of reclusive Elven mystics and visionaries who have influenced practically all subsequent Elven mystical traditions, though they were not the originators of the first [[Lunar mysteries]] traditions. In the earliest days, they are said to have sung the [[High Towers]] into form out of great redwood trees, which they used as gathering-points for Dawnlight energy and to conduct elaborate alchemical experiments. In the [[Second Great Age]], the Yrilari advanced their knowledge of the Arcane tremendously through cultural and intellectual exchange with [[Neyjarin]] mystics, particularly those of the [[Nyr’Alel]] Tribes, as well as the introduction of emerging esoteric and scientific literature of the [[Isztani]]. They became well versed in the [[Selumine Mysteries]], as well as scholars of [[Ik’Torö]], and developed a codified system of embedding runic truth-words into the frames of the classical  [[Sz’Gyrhic Engrams]], giving birth to the [[Old Silrune]] language, which made them finally able to easily share their wisdom with any and all worthy students capable of making The Journey of the Golden Flight.
