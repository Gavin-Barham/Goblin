The Kaldari gnomes are more or less ubiquitous to [[Shaal’Rond]], and have resided exclusively underground until the last century. Little is known of their origin, but it is speculated they are of a distant relation to the [[Sz’Gyra]]. Reports of the [[Kaldari Trade Princes]] date back to the [[Second Great Age]]. Organized by a complex hierarchy of independent clans or Trade Houses, the Kaldari built elaborate subterranean estates in which different Princes would specialize in various crafts, acquiring and mentoring apprentices and maintaining the only regular trade caravans known to have been sent to the Dwarves of the [[Yhogvaen Mountain range]] home to the [[Kingdoms of Yhogvaen]].
