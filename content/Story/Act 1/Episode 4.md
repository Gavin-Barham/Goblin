What lurks beneath?

Through a bit of effort the gang managed to find a path they could traverse without drowning, and Elara proceeded ahead to ensure it was safe to travel for her less constitution focused allies. After entering the next chamber she was surprise attacked by another tendril, luckily for her [[Grev]] was there to help take care of the creature and keep Elara from going down completely.

The room happened to be full of rotting corpses as well as a number of magical items, Elara found a ring, a glowing rapier, a dagger, a wand, and a halberd. [[Elara]] kept hold of the ring, while [[Denver]] received the rapier and dagger, [[Vylle]] was given the wand, and [[9]] got the halberd.

After proceeding to the next room the party encountered [[Eskos]] a gnomish warrior is search of a prince of the [[Kaldari]] houses. [[Eskos]] and the group began to proceed due to lack of time, however [[9]] was stuck in the passage to the current room so [[Elara]] stayed behind to help him out.
