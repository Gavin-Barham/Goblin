What lurks beneath?

With a little overs a days travel the group came across an infested lake with a waterfall. Upon closer investigation the group was suddenly ambushed by vine like tendrils that protruded from the lake.

After defeating the tendrils, the group found a cave entrance that led through a seemingly sunken cave network. [[Vylle]] sent his familiar in to investigate and found several submerged passages and tunnels, as well as the presence of a gnomish figure slaying goblins along his way.

Through a bit of effort the gang managed to find a path they could traverse without drowning, and Elara proceeded ahead to ensure it was safe to travel for her less constitution focused allies. After entering the next chamber she was surprise attacked by another tendril, luckily for her [[Grev]] was there to help take care of the creature and keep Elara from going down completely.

The room happened to be full of rotting corpses as well as a number of magical items, Elara found a ring, a glowing rapier, a dagger, a wand, and a halberd. [[Elara]] kept hold of the ring, while [[Denver]] received the rapier and dagger, [[Vylle]] was given the wand, and [[9]] got the halberd.

After proceeding to the next room the party encountered [[Eskos]] a gnomish warrior is search of a prince of the [[Kaldari]] houses. [[Eskos]] and the group began to proceed due to lack of time, however [[9]] was stuck in the passage to the current room so [[Elara]] stayed behind to help him out.
