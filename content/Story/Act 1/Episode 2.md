Its a trap!

The group awoke fresh in the morning and stumbled across a dense patch of wooded area. Upon entering they were greeted by a small bird, seemingly in distress and hinting us to follow it. Upon finding a river crossing the wagon could not traverse the group took 1 of the soldiers and continued following the avian creature on foot.

The bird eventually led to a trap by some nomads, however they were mostly friendly and didn't give the group much trouble and actually asked for aid in finding a missing druid [[Kaphira]] that led their group. She was said to have been lost near a viridian horde hatchery. The group decided to help on the condition the nomads with look after the caravan and their people in the groups stead, and should anything happen they be taken to a permanent encampment the nomads are based out of.
