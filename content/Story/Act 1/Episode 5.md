Find the prince!

[[Elara]] growing impatient as the group moved further away from herself and [[9]], used an earthen grasp to free nine from the surrounding rocks and they began sprinting after the rest of their party.

The group of [[Denver]], [[Vylle]], [[Eskos]], and [[Grev]] proceeded forward at [[Eskos]] behest. They moved through a few champers taking out a room of goblin eggs, as well as a few foot soldiers in the process.

When [[Elara]] and [[9]] finally caught up with the group they were in a large cavern with a pit of acid and a gaping maw in the center.

The group traveled carefully by having [[Vylle]] spider climbing along the ceiling ferrying the others across.

Upon entering the final unchecked chamber of the cavern, the came across a small group of [[Viridian Hordes]].

After the group successful killed what goblins they found, and searching the room it was discovered that 
[[Gilthesus Mez'Tholir]] prince of [[Mez'Rimor]] was tied up in the room as well as a small prison holding [[]], a small gnomish woman who was said to be traveling with a cat.

The group realizes this must be the infected cat they saw earlier in the cavern. The group took a rest at this point while [[Denver]] focused on building a small fire, [[Elara]] began looking into the magic ring they had found earlier.

It turned out there was an entity living inside of it. He spoke of his last bearer [[Cortephus]], a gnomish Arch Mage of the [[Kaldari]] house of [[Mez'Tholir]] of the city [[Mez'Rimor]]. The entity mentioned it wanted to seek a [[Yrilari Master]] or the [[Primark]], and asked to speak with a [[Kaldari]] noble as soon as possible.

After [[Denver]] started the fire we began feeling trembling and screams, under the gross skin-like strip of floor was a mouth and eye in what looked to be a tunnel of flesh. [[Vylle]] and [[Eskos]] began carving their way through the flesh to find "the heart" that [[Vylle]] had been sensing.

Upon finding and slaying "the heart", [[Vylle]] convinced [[Eskos]] to head back and while no one was looking consumed blood from "the heart" to feed his persistent hunger.

Upon reaching the cat again [[9]] laid on hands to cure both the cat and the gnomish woman of the [[black rot]] disease. It turns out the cat was [[k]] the missing Druid we were searching for.

After reaching the mouth of the cave safely it was quickly apparent that there were [[Viridian Hordes]] sniffing about, with 2 large ones and a few smaller ones.
