Lakeside ambush

With a little overs a days travel the group came across an infested lake with a waterfall. Upon closer investigation the group was suddenly ambushed by vine like tendrils that protruded from the lake.

After defeating the tendrils, the group found a cave entrance that led through a seemingly sunken cave network. [[Vylle]] sent his familiar in to investigate and found several submerged passages and tunnels, as well as the presence of a gnomish figure slaying goblins along his way.
