[[Ul'Sidhar]] sent [[Elara]], [[Denver]], [[Vylle]], and [[9]], on a mission to find [[Tr√∂un-Paheyr]], it was said answers might be found past the Desert's. The group was told to meet with a man named [[Akavat]]. He is said to be a trusted contact who can help get through the rough terrains and conditions of the [[Sjaleeri Desert]].

The group was also to bring a caravan of Irilarian villagers and 3 [[Sihl'Darjhul]] warriors [[Ayl'Sanrimar]], [[Jelariele]], and [[]] to help them secure safe passage across the desert as well. 

After a short period of travel the group was assaulted in the night by a small band of viridian horde, however were able to turn the tides and make it out alive. After fleeing the area and finishing off a couple of riders who followed the groups trail they stumbled across a dense patch of wooded area.

Upon entering they were greeted by a small bird, seemingly in distress and hinting us to follow it. Upon finding a river crossing the wagon could not traverse the group took 1 of the soldiers and continued following the avian creature on foot.

The bird eventually led to a trap by some nomads, however they were mostly friendly and didn't give the group much trouble and actually asked for aid in finding a missing druid [[k]] that led their group. She was said to have been lost near a viridian horde hatchery. The group decided to help on the condition the nomads with look after the caravan and their people in the groups stead, and should anything happen they be taken to a permanent encampment the nomads are based out of.

With a little overs a days travel the group came across an infested lake with a waterfall. Upon closer investigation the group was suddenly ambushed by vine like tendrils that protruded from the lake.

After defeating the tendrils, the group found a cave entrance that led through a seemingly sunken cave network. [[Vylle]] sent his familiar in to investigate and found several submerged passages and tunnels, as well as the presence of a gnomish figure slaying goblins along his way.

Through a bit of effort the gang managed to find a path they could traverse without drowning, and Elara proceeded ahead to ensure it was safe to travel for her less constitution focused allies. After entering the next chamber she was surprise attacked by another tendril, luckily for her [[Grev]] was there to help take care of the creature and keep Elara from going down completely.

The room happened to be full of rotting corpses as well as a number of magical items, Elara found a ring, a glowing rapier, a dagger, a wand, and a halberd. [[Elara]] kept hold of the ring, while [[Denver]] received the rapier and dagger, [[Vylle]] was given the wand, and [[9]] got the halberd.

After proceeding to the next room the party encountered [[Eskos]] a gnomish warrior is search of a prince of the [[Kaldari]] houses. [[Eskos]] and the group began to proceed due to lack of time, however [[9]] was stuck in the passage to the current room so [[Elara]] stayed behind to help him out.

When [[Elara]] and [[9]] finally caught up with the group they were in a large cavern with a pit of acid and a gaping maw in the center.

The group traveled carefully by having [[Vylle]] spider climbing along the ceiling ferrying the others across.

Upon entering the final unchecked chamber of the cavern, the came across a small group of [[Verdant Horde]].

After the group successful killed what goblins they found, and searching the room it was discovered that 
[[Gilthesus Mez'Tholir]] prince of [[Mez'Rimor]] was tied up in the room as well as a small prison holding [[]], a small gnomish woman who was said to be traveling with a cat.

The group realizes this must be the infected cat they saw earlier in the cavern. The group took a rest at this point while [[Denver]] focused on building a small fire, [[Elara]] began looking into the magic ring they had found earlier.

It turned out there was an entity living inside of it. He spoke of his last bearer [[Cortephus]], a gnomish Arch Mage of the [[Kaldari]] house of [[Mez'Tholir]] of the city [[Mez'Rimor]]. The entity mentioned it wanted to seek a [[Yrilari Master]] or the [[Primark]], and asked to speak with a [[Kaldari]] noble as soon as possible.

After [[Denver]] started the fire we began feeling trembling and screams, under the gross skin-like strip of floor was a mouth and eye in what looked to be a tunnel of flesh. [[Vylle]] and [[Eskos]] began carving their way through the flesh to find "the heart" that [[Vylle]] had been sensing.

Upon finding and slaying "the heart", [[Vylle]] convinced [[Eskos]] to head back and while no one was looking consumed blood from "the heart" to feed his persistent hunger.

Upon reaching the cat again [[9]] laid on hands to cure both the cat and the gnomish woman of the [[black rot]] disease. It turns out the cat was [[k]] the missing Druid we were searching for.
