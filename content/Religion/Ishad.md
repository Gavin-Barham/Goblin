[[Ishad]] , or The Dawn principle, is a god of the sun, of truth, of light, and knowledge. His devotees are marked by their forthright and earnest natures, intolerance for deceit, and the transparent, non-hierarchical nature of their theological sermons, which often derail into impassioned discussions or even debates. Anyone may attend a sermon of Ishad and speak if they feel moved by truth.
