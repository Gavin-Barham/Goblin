(S,M) ([[Nirin]]) - A dying language from the [[Halooda Marshes]]. It arrived in [[Lir’Et’Traala]] with the influx of human and halfling survivors from the [[Nirin]] villages. It has persisted a few generations within the tight-knit community of [[Irilar]]’s [[Haldoji]] refugee families, but in daily life it is largely replaced with [[Ansylar]]. While the [[Haldoji]] have no written language for words, they did invent [[Nijut]].
