(S,Wr,M) ([[Ik’Töro]]) - “The Divine Language”, proclaimed by the first [[Izstani]] Emperor, [[Hadje Göro I]]. Also known as “The Tongue of Ishad”. It is uncommon as a spoken language these days in the [[Nir’Et’Traala]] or [[Radhymar]], and even rarer to find someone who knows how to read it. There is still much surviving literature in the region written in [[Izjydi]], which is invaluable to academics due to the fact that speaking falseness in [[Izjydi]] was a severe taboo. (Knowingly recording falseness and presenting it as a fact was specifically an Arch-Heresy that would result in banishment or beheading.)
