(S, Wx, M) (Glîrhylic) - Tongue of the first gnomes; the wildgnomes, or [[Sz’Gyrha]]. Language of puzzles, riddles, and the unsaid. To speak a phrase in perfect truth by [[Glîrhylic]] is to perform an illusion in itself. It exists only as the illusion of language, conveying cryptic feeling and insight into the matter at hand, but emerging, spontaneously, and without the repetition, stability of specific verbal meanings, or any of the typical trappings of language. Written only in contextual clues surrounding a mystery, or answers to a riddle posed pictographically. The most common surviving way of inscribing [[Glîrhylic]] text is in the form of a puzzle box. These boxes never exceed the size of 5”x5” cubes, but can be packed with the information of up to 10,000 words.
