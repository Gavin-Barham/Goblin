(S,M,Wx) (Ghahesh) - Tongue of the Canyon-Howlers. Language of the first dwarves. Not a common vehicle of conversation today, in all but the most isolated of dwarven communities. Can be written only in the weave of mail, the folds of Ghârapõn steel, or the curvature of a lovingly-honed blade. The old magics lie potent in this tongue.**
