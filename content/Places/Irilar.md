The village of Irilar sits deep in the heart of the [[Lir’Et’Traala]].  For generations it has stewarded those who remain from the scattered cultures and peoples of [[Shaal’Rond]]. Populated by a motley assortment of eight-dozen or so households, it was founded by the [[Nyr’Alel]] Tribes at the suggestion of the [[Yrilari]] Masters [[Tröun-Paheyr]] to house all those who came to the [[Lir’Et’Traala]] for refuge in the wake of the [[Second Scourging]]. Today it stands as a cobbled-together band of inhabited structures ranging from the forest floor to the uppermost boughs of the canopy. It is currently presided over by the [[Nyrwi’Irai Council]], a gathering of ten leaders. Though there is one council seat each to represent the various interests of the [[Rhadymani]], the [[Nirin]] of the Halooda Marshes, the [[Iszadar Order of The Dusking Light]], and the [[Kaldari]] Princes-in-Exile, the majority of decisions are handled by the Six Elders of the [[Nyr’Alel]]. [[Irilar]] has a strong foundation in the traditions of the [[Selumine Mysteries]], and the Six Elders are all practicing [[Silidar]]. Life in [[Irilar]] is as varied as its peoples. Many refugee families tend to farmsteads on the forest floor, or occupy workshops in the lower spires. The small [[Nirin]], or Haldoji-speaking community within Irilar is quite tight-knit, consisting of a few extended families of halflings and humans whose ancestors occupied the [[Halooda Marshes]]. They do not practice [[The Fasting Balance]], refuse to give up children to [[The Offering]], and abstain from consuming [[Ulhag’Ir]], choosing to subsist on the fish of the Rhadymar river, and the wild roots, grains, and tubers they help to cultivate along its banks. On years where [[The Festival of The Unseen Harvest ]]takes place, the [[Nirin]] clan sequester themselves in encampments along the Rhadymar River bank for a month until all ceremonies are complete. The [[Kaldari]], ever fond of their privacy and seclusion of the homestead, tend to live in opulent tree-houses high in the upper spires, though near-surface underground dwellings in proximity to the village center are the most highly coveted among them. Many of the descendants of the [[Nyr’Alel]] still practice the same traditional way of life they have for generations, gathering their sustenance from the wilds, always in balance, sight-unseen, applying the inner-knowing of the [[Lunar mysteries]] to illuminate the dark and wild places of the [[Lir’Et’Traala]]. Living in this way, in the guidance of [[Selumei]]’s wisdom, to know that all which lurks unknown in the mind is of the same substance and character and contains the same Eternal Teachings as that which lurks unknown in the wilds, is called walking [[The Silent Path]].
