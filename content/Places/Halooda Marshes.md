The Halooda Marshes have played host to a variety of cultures, though all that remains in the common knowledge of the [[Nyrwimar]] of their legacy are the [[Nirin]] people, who came as refugees over the last few decades. In the time before the [[Nirin]], it is said the marshes were home to a powerful and secluded druidic order, even by [[Neyjarin]] standards. They eluded all attempts by the [[Nyrâ€™Alel]] to parlay, or even be discovered, and little else is known of them.
