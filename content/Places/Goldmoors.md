The Goldmoors were first home to the [[Gamari Caliphate]]. A loose-knit community of warring clans descended from the Second Wanderers who excelled at horseback archery and land warfare. There is still a wealth of Gamari poetry and written music scattered about the [[Goldmoors]], but it is speculated that this represents only a fraction of a vast oral tradition that did not make the transition to written language after they were conquered by the Empire. For hundreds, perhaps thousands of years following, the [[Goldmoors]] were simply an [[Isztani]] province that exported massive quantities of horses, honey, wine, and spirits. After the fall, the provincial government gave way to the [[Radhymani City-States]], which organized with the [[Yrilari]] Masters and the [[Nyrâ€™Alel]] to form the [[Triumvirate]].
