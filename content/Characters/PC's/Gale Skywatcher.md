Gale Skywatcher is a dutiful apprentice of the [[Wardens of the wilds]] and son to [[Glimmerdew Tinkertoes]]. He was found by Glimmerdew in an egg one day that was gifted to him for some work he did. To his surprise right as the over got to temp so did the egg and out hatched Gale. He serves his community through flight and surveillance as well as taking care of grunt work like delivering shoes back and forth between the wardens and his father for repairs. His gift of flight has also given him cursed visions and a sense of fading hope. 

He now directly serves under [[Jiid'ralsyar]] high warden and close aquantences of [[Seridil Kismei]], [[Naleae]], and [[Alendrial]].
